_______________
M/S Shree Dudhganga Vedganga Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd; Bidri (Mouninagar), Tal- Kagal,
Dist-Kolhapur (SDVSSKL) has been registered under registration no. G-279 of 1956 dated
October 10, 1956, It is one of the most progressive sugar factory in the state of Maharashtra.
Factory is operating 7500 TCD sugarcane crushing capacity and 30 MW cogeneration power
plant. The existing Sugar unit is geographically located at Lat 16°25'44"N & Long 74° 08'17"E, at
a maximum elevation of 559 m MSL.

The project titled "30 MW Bagasse-Based Co-Generation by M/S Shree Dudhganga Vedganga
Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd; Bidri (Mouninagar)" is a bagasse-based co-generation (co-gen)
power project successfully commissioned by Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission
Company Limited (MSETCL).

 The 20 MW Turbine was commissioned on February 29, 2012.

 Another 10 MW Turbine was synchronized on December 06, 2022, and started exporting power
on December 06, 2022. From December 06, 2022, the total capacity of the project proponent's
turbine was 30 MW.

The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass (Bagasse)
and thereby reduce GHG emissions by displacing the fossil fuel dominated grid based electricity
with biomass based renewable electricity. The electricity produced by the project is directly
contributing to climate change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent amount of fossil
power at grid.

The PP has set up an integrated sugar mill with sugar crushing capacity of 7500 TCD. This will
remove the dependency of the sugar mill on the power supplied from the state grid. 

Monthly joint meter reading of main meters installed at interconnection points are taken and
signed by authorized officials of and MSETCL on the first five days of every month. Records of
this joint meter reading are maintained by M/S Shree Dudhganga Vedganga Sahakari Sakhar
Karkhana Ltd and MSETCL. Daily and monthly reports stating the net powerexport is prepared
by the shift in-charge and verified by the plant manager. Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with
MSETCL has been signed. Reliability of energy data is maintained as per PPA. M/S Shree
Dudhganga Vedganga Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd archives and preserves all the monthly
invoices raised against net saleable energy and also archives the complete metering data at
generation electronically.

All the records are maintained at site. Maharashtra Pollution Control
Board (MPCB) and Environment Department of Maharashtra have prescribed standards of
environmental compliance and monitor the adherence to the standards M/S Shree Dudhganga
Vedganga Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd has received the ‘Consent to Operate’ the plant. State’s
regulatory body of power is Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited
(MSEDCL) and they have issued consent for the installation of co-generation power plant of 35
MW capacity. As a buyer of the power, the MSEDCL is a major stakeholder in the project and
hold the key to the commercial success of the project.






generated from this project activity will be used for meeting plant requirement. After fulfilling
its captive energy requirement, remaining power will be sold to the state grid as per the Power
Purchase Agreement / Energy Purchase agreement.
